React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where you need a fast and interactive experience

Advantages:
	Component-Based Architecture: Break down your UI into reusable pieces (components), making your code modular and easy to manage.

	Virtual DOM: React updates only what's necessary, leading to faster performance.

	State Management: Keep track of dynamic data easily, allowing for interactive and responsive UIs.

	Hooks: Use built-in tools for managing state and side effects in a clean and efficient way.
	
Creating new react app using vite :- npm create vite@latest

Now run:
  cd vite-project
  npm install
  npm run dev
  
work flow:-

index.html  --> div (root) --> main.jsx (app render)--> app.jsx
  |-> index.css                      |-> app.css       		|-> <p> hello world  </p>

Rout command : npm i react-router-dom

React hook form command: npm i react-hook-form

Redux:
