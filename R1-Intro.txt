React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications where you need a fast and interactive experience

Advantages:
	Component-Based Architecture: Break down your UI into reusable pieces (components), making your code modular and easy to manage.

	Virtual DOM: React updates only what's necessary, leading to faster performance.

	State Management: Keep track of dynamic data easily, allowing for interactive and responsive UIs.

	Hooks: Use built-in tools for managing state and side effects in a clean and efficient way.
